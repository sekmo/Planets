# Planets

A small exercise to practice component rendering in React

## What's this?

We have an array of planets, with names, descriptions, image urls, etc. - and we want to display them using react components.

1. Create a 'Planet' component that renders a planet card
2. Create a 'PlanetList' component, which is a container that iterates over the planets array and renders a 'Planet' component for each object in the array 
3. Render the container component to the DOM

## How to run it

`yarn global add http-server` to install http-server package in a global fashion (like `npm add -g`)

`http-server final` to serve from the directory "final"
